P: Hi Doctor, I'm just having a lot of chest pain and and so I thought I should get it checked out.

D: OK, and so when did this chest pain start?

P: It started last night, but it's becoming sharper.

D: OK, and where is this pain located? 

P: It's located on the left side of my chest.

D: OK. Has it been constant throughout that time, or uh, or changing? 

P: I would say it's been pretty constant, yeah.

D: OK, and how would you describe the pain? Does it feel sharp, burning, achy?

P: I'd say it's pretty sharp, yeah.

D: Sharp OK. Uh, anything that you have tried since last night that's made the pain better?

P: Um not laying down helps.

D: OK, so do you find laying down makes the pain worse?

P: Yes, definitely.

D: OK, do you find that the pain is radiating or moving around anywhere?

P: No.

D: OK, and is there anything else that makes the pain worse besides laying down? 

P: Not that I've noticed, no.

D: OK, so not like taking a deep breath or anything like that?

P: Maybe taking a deep breath. Yeah.

D: OK. And when the pain started, could you tell me uh, what you were doing at the time?

P: I mean, I was moving some furniture around, but, that I've done that before.

D: OK, so you didn't feel like you hurt yourself when you were doing that?

P: No.

D: OK, and with the pain, do you have any other symptoms with the chest pain?

P: I feel a little lightheaded and I'm having some trouble breathing. I guess like my neck seems to be a little swollen too.

D: OK. Have you had any loss of consciousness?

P: No.

D: OK. Uh, have you been experiencing any like racing of the heart? 

P: Um, a little bit, yeah.

D: OK. And have you been sweaty at all?

P: Just from the from having issues breathing.

D: OK, have you been having issues breathing since the pain started? 

P: Yes.

D: OK. And have you been feeling sick at all? Any infectious symptoms? 

P: No.

P: No.

D: OK, and is there anything else that you wanted to tell me about today?

P: No, I don't think so. I think you asked me everything.

D. Alright. Let’s do a physical exam. I’m just going to take a quick listen to your heart and lungs to make sure everything sounds alright. Can you breathe in and out for me?

P: Sure.

D: Alright. Your lungs and heart sound normal to me. I’m going to feel your neck since you said it’s a bit swollen.

P: Sure

D: OK. Your lymph nodes don’t feel swollen to me, which is a good sign. So here’s what I think should be our next steps. I’m going to order an exercise stress test for you to do, which will help figure out if there’s anything wrong with your heart. I’m also going to order bloodwork to rule out any possible infection that might be causing your chest pain. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you 2 pills of aspirin to take as needed when you feel that chest pain, and we’ll see if that helps relieve the pain. And let’s follow up once we get all the test results back. My office will contact you to set up an appointment in a few weeks. How does that sound? 

P: Sounds great Doc. Thanks!

D: Great. Do you have any questions for me or any other concerns?

P: Nope, I’ll get those tests done and we’ll talk after then.

D: Perfect. Have a good day!

Could you please provide a summary of this transcript in the form of SOAP notes?,"D: Hey Paul. What brings you in here today?

P: Yeah, I've just been feeling breathless and it's getting worse. So I wanted to check it out.

D: OK, and did it come on about like gradually through time or suddenly just happened?

P: I guess gradually, yeah.

D: OK. And, do you feel, uh, how often do you feel breathless?

P: No.

D: OK, and do you have any wet cough or any productive cough or are you producing like sputum or phlegm?

P: Yeah, I guess I'd say I have this frothy sputum.

D: OK, and has your breathlessness been getting any worse at all over the last two months?

P: I would say so, yes.

D: OK, and you mentioned like exertion makes it worse, but anything else like going outside or exposure to any allergens or anything that makes it worse?

P: Uh, I don't think so.

D: OK, and how about a positional changes? Does lying flat at all make it worse?

P: I would say so, yes. Yeah, I'm basically gasping for air when I lay down.

D: OK, and do you ever find yourself waking up at night in the middle of the night to catch your breath?

P: No.

D: No, OK. And when do you feel the breathlessness the most? Is it more so during the day or at night?

P: I guess it's worse at night because I'm laying down. 

D: OK And was there anything new that happened in your life recently since I last saw you? Any new medical diagnosis recently? Or any travel that happened before you started having these symptoms?

P: No, nothing like that.

D: OK. And, does anything make it better? Like any positional changes makes the breathlessness go away?

P: I guess when I I'm not laying down or when I'm laying down, I try to add pillows, stack pillows so that it gets better. 

D: OK, and are you having any other symptoms like sore throat, runny nose, chest pain, dizziness, anything like that? 

P: No. 

D: OK, any headache nausea or vomiting? 

P: Um, no.

D: OK, any weight loss, fevers or chills or night sweats.

D: OK, have you had any recent infections like a cold at all? 

P: No. 

D: OK. And has the shortness of breath been affecting your daily routine at home or at work at all?

P: Yeah, I would say so. It's been hard to make it to work and then standing around all day or if I have to go help out with something and exert myself too much, I get short of breath. 

D: OK. And has your lifestyle changed since we last spoke? Are you getting a balanced diet?

P: I wouldn't say well balanced. I'm trying to eat healthier but doesn't always happen.

D: OK, and how about exercise? Do you find that your exercise levels or activity levels have gone down in the last two months?

P: Yes. 

D: OK. Alright, is there any other questions or concerns that you have or something I may have missed to ask you today?

P: No, I don't think so. 

D: Alright, I’m going to do a quick physical exam and listen to your hearts and lungs.

P: Alright. 

D: So it sounds like there’s a bit of fluid in your lungs, and I hear what’s called an S3 heart sound, but it’s pretty soft. There’s also some mild swelling in your legs, what we call edema. So based on your history and symptoms, you might be having what's called congestive heart failure. So we will need to do further investigations to determine if that is what it is. Given the fluid build up uh I’m going to prescribe you some Lasix which is basically a water pill that’ll make you pee more and hopefully that’ll make the swelling go down a bit in your legs. So we'll start with that and some bloodwork and then go from there. Any questions about that?

P: Alright doc, hey whatever you say sounds good to me.

P: Yeah, so this chest pain has just been coming on for the last couple of weeks now.

D: OK, uhm. So 2 weeks, and can you tell me kind of where you're feeling that pain?

D: OK, and is it constant like on all the time, or do you feel like it kind of comes and goes?

D: About the same, OK, and has it gotten more frequent, these like 20 to 30 minute episodes?

D: OK, but do you feel like you have been more stressed out in general?

P: Uh, yeah the last couple of years have been a lot more stressful because of those issues in my personal life.

D: OK, I'm sorry to hear that, but I'm glad that you're coming in and we can hopefully get to the bottom of this. Not that I think that's necessarily the source of your pain, and we definitely want to look into everything, but it is really helpful to know that. So when you've had these episodes, have you taken anything to help with the pain or done anything that's that you felt it made it go away?

P: Uhm, I've tried some Advil, some Tylenol and actually some Tums as well, and it hasn't really helped.

D: OK, do you think it's worse when you're moving around, if you're if you're kind of doing more exercise, or is it kind of just the same no matter what you're doing when you get the episodes?

P: Oh, it actually I I feel like it happens most of the time when I'm either at work or or driving. 

D: OK. OK, and before this two week period, have you ever had anything like this before?

P: No, I haven't had anything like this happen before.

D: And just jumping back to these pain episodes when you have them, do you experience anything else? Do you get any nausea or vomiting?

P: Sure.

D: So everything sounds normal right now. So what I’m going to do is order an ECG and bloodwork, which will help make sure there’s nothing major going on. And is there anything else that you wanted to to tell me about that we didn’t go over?

P: Uh, no, I think that's um, yeah, I think that's all that I wanted to talk about today.
